# Course on DataFrames with Pandas

This repository 📦 contains a collection of Python 🐍 code snippets demonstrating how to use the Pandas library for data manipulation. Pandas is an essential library for tabular data manipulation in Python, offering DataFrames 📊 and a wide range of functions 🧬 to work with these DataFrames.

## Contents 📋

Here's an overview of the topics covered in this repository:

1. **Creating Pandas DataFrames**:
    - Importing Pandas.
    - Creating a DataFrame from random data.
    - Setting an index and column names for the DataFrame.

1. **Exploring DataFrames**:
    - Using methods to explore DataFrames, such as `info()`, `head()`, `tail()`, and `describe()`.

2. **Accessing Data**:
    - Accessing data within the DataFrame, including selecting specific columns.
    - Calculating new columns based on existing data.

3. **Manipulating DataFrames**:
    - Deleting columns and rows.
    - Setting a custom index with `set_index`.
    - Resetting the index with `reset_index`.

4. **Accessing Data by Position and Label**:
    - Using `iloc` for position-based access.
    - Using `loc` for label-based access.

5. **Adding Rows**:
    - Adding rows to a DataFrame with `append`.
